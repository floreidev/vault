# Overview

Saltworth is a sleepy town located on the outer edge of the spotted isles, a large cluster of small islands, some no bigger than a few houses. Efforts, however successful or futile, have been made to thwart the ongoing pirate infestation. It is important to note that this pirate infestation is not necessarily a negative thing, some pirates aid others, some pillage and steal, and others just wish to live a life of the sea. In the navy's books, these are all the same. A new wave of rebellious youth groups has led to a further tightening of the navy's restrictions; all sea travel, unless explicitly sanctioned by the navy, is now outlawed. When the town of Saltworth is hit by a navy bombardment (the first navy attack on land since the battle of Cratsp'ah), our heroes must choose which side they are on.

  

# Introduction

> We start our adventure in the sleepy town of Saltworth, where the plain blue crest is about as dull as the old citizens. The amenities throughout the town are minimal, and a large focus has been placed on housing rather than having fun things to do.


_It is suggested you let each player explore the town before jumping into the event in [[#Introduction##Under Fire]]_

## Saltworth

Saltworth, as previously stated, is a small sleepy town located on the outer edge of the spotted isles. It is one of the smallest isles that is still considered its own town, and therefore has its own governing body. It is home to around 250 citizens, who get along with each other fairly well, notwithstanding the odd menial dispute. There is a small market along the centre of the town, with a collection of houses either side of the main road. At one end of this long stretching road is a large tavern/hotel, which houses guests and visitors and serves the customary drink of saltworth: foambroth brew. At the other end is a large mayoral building, where the mayor resides and makes decissions about the town. Events will also often be held in the main hall of this building.

### Grugart's Tavern

Grugart's Tavern is located on the west end of the town, and is a towering, victorian-esque building where the top is much heavier than the bottom. When you get close you hear the hum of regulars chatting, and, on crocball game days, you hear excitable laughter and chatter. Grugart, the bartender, hotel manager and bouncer of the tavern is a gentle-giant orc who is incredibly easy to get along with

> [!tip]- Foambroth Brew
> Foambroth is an... accquired taste. It is made from skimming the foam off the sea and infusing it with a bitter, meat-based wine. It is incredibly alcoholic.

> [!tip]- Identification in the Spotted Isles
> In order to crack down on outlaw pirates, the navy have issued a spotted isles ID card to all citizens. This card is used to verify people's ages in the pub. You should determine if the players will have these ID cards, and it is reccomended you give physical copies to the ones that do.

> Grutgart charges the standard hotel rate for 5e, except for on game days where he charges an extra 1GP

### Market
The market in Saltworth is temperamental, with some days being a bustling hub of community and commerce, and others being a desolate sign of bad governance. Today, its pretty busy, with one or two people visiting each of the 20-ish stalls selling bits and bobs, from bric-a-bracs to potions. Below is a list of relevant markets and their sellers.

#### Relevant Market Stalls

> [!tip]- Grugart's Takeaway
> Grugart has hired his son, Gru Jr., to sell takeaway bottles of foambroth for 5sp each. If you talk to him, he'll tell you a bit about Grugart's Hotel and the towns history (or lack thereof). See [[The Sea and Spotted Isles#Grugart's Tavern]] for more info

> [!tip]- Blacksmith
> A blacksmith, Seamus, is available to mend, upgrade and even create new weapons, if you convince him

### Mayoral Building
Events will often be held here, in the large hall that superceeds the entrance. In the entrance there is a large notice board with jobs and jobseerks posters alike. A little office that juts off to the left of the entrance is where the Mayor, Gorfarth, is furiously flipping through important documents concerning the strengthening of the navy. Obviously increased patrols by the military have affected many local economies.

Talking to mayor Gorfarth yields few results except dismissal as he is “busy”



### Introductions
#### Curk (cb)

> We enter Grugart’s Tavern, not only the biggest tavern in Saltworth, but the only tavern in Saltworth. Talking to Grugart, the keeper of the Tavern, is an Aaracocora named Curk, and she appears to be saying something about her girlfriend
#### Cadwaldr (ic)

> Only a few metres away from Curk is Cadwaldr the Dragonborn, sitting at a large table of regular customers. He seems to be convincing them of why a statue should be built in his honour.
#### Carmen (mw)

> In the back alleys of the town, lurking behind houses and gardens is Lyra
> …
> Close on her tail is a large law enforcement officer, chasing her through the narrow streets.
#### Kaya (krc)

> And finally, at Saltworth’s desolate dock we see Kaya, the famed movie star, arriving on the latest leg of her journey through the spotted isles.

## Under Fire

> Suddenly the earth begins to shake. Then shake again. And finally, as people begin to quiet down and stand up, a whistling sound can be heard. Thwiiiiiiieeeeewoooooo before a final loud explosion causes the entire island the quake. Loud shouting is heard from the dock as everyone rushes to find out what happened.

At the dock there is a small navy warship containing 3 infantrymen, 2 archers and a sergeant, all of varying races. They are stubborn, aggressive and abide the law down to the letter (unless, that is, it benefits them). They give little information about why they are here about apart from “new orders to persecute criminals”. Truly, they are here
