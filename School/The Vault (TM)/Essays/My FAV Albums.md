note: this isnt necessary about my fav albums as taking an album as a generic/arbitrary collection of music, I'm talking ALBUMS, collections of songs with thematic and structural similarities that connect well. 

also all of these will flip from being wildly formal and serious to flippant and/or personal/emotional/non-descriptive because its my essay and i chose how i wanna write it.
# Maggot - Dazey and the Scouts
The one and only album from Dazey and the Scouts, this "intimate" collection explores the theme of intimacy and sex from an inherently and both implicitly queer perspective, containing brash and vulgar language alongside a set of powerful and deeply emotional vocals, every song links together in terms of instruments, lyrics and passion.
## Groan 
The opening song, Groan, showcases the depth of the themes alongside vocal range perfectly, and is probably one of the best songs in the album. Taking on the challenging task of exploring the unhealthy relationship between a groomer and their victim from the perspective of the "young, naive and really miserable" victim. The song begins with a low guitar riff followed by a moan, something which will be repeated throughout the song, immediatley introducing the sexual tones of the song. The introductory lyric furthers a sense of secrecy, "Won't you come around in your car in the middle of the night again?", following it up by showing the singer longing for release from a self-destructive state; "I've got a thundering storm cloud hanging low above my head again", the verb thundering chosen over rainfall as it shows the self-destructive and harmful idea.

The following for lines then finalize the narrative of the song, 
> And if I lied about my age, is it fine?
Would you mind?
Sorry, we can blame it on that I'm
Young, naÃ¯ve, and really miserable

The singer is aware of the fact that this relationship is wrong to a certain extent, but only in the way that it is *illegal*. We'll see this further in the song, but the idea that the acts are only wrong due to the law and that the speaker believes that they are mature enough to engage in sex is a key theme running throughout, and is often a belief held by victims, and later regretted. The final line in this extract emphasizes the self-awareness, showing that they know how to explain away and excuse their behaviour. 

> And yeah, I wanna spend the night with you
Yeah, I wanna feel a beating, bleeding heart, don't you?
Because I've never really known

The beginning of this chorus displays the longing that the speaker has. The direct address and the repeating of the verb phrase "wanna" shows the plea from the singer toward their groomer and rings of childlike obsession and one-sided requests. The final line also reinforces the young age of the singer, they've "never really known". While "never known" on its own is an obvious reference to the desire for an intimate relationship, the adverb "really" exemplifies how, while the singer may have been in a relationship before, they view this one as more "mature" and "real", an extension of how they feel about themselves. Furthermore, the previous line states they wished to feel a "beating, bleeding heart", referring to a longing or two-way relationship with another person, a 'true, deep connection', something which, from what we can infer, they believe is only possible through sex. This idea of sexuality being equivalent to maturity is something often found in older teens. 

> But I pinky-promise you I'm grown
And I wanna know what it feels like

These are probably the two most inc
