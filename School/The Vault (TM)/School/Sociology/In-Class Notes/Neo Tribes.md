# Neo Tribes

---

Youth subcultures are no longer as populous or 'spectaculars'

- ***Maffesoli***: A neo-tribe is a group of people who have chosen to come together for a particular period of time and place for a specific reason

- Temporal associations - associations that only exist for a specific reason and period of time.

---

- Casual youth groups → slightly distinctive styles and set of values. Some can be formalised, others are more freeform. People can choose lifestyle or images and mix.

  - May include things such as religions, sports, online gaming fan groups etc.

The term neo-tribe was probably coined by Maffesoli but used by Bennett to describe modern youth cultures. They have a loose structure based on lifestyle and consumer choices, They share a common world view rather than a class position.

Bennett rejects the view that class/social background shapes the behaviour of young people.

Zygmunt Bauman (1992) argued that the certitudes of life, such as class and gender have become less significant in an increasingly unstable and liquid world

  

> Postmodernists suggested that youth cultures had become so commercialised that very few young people would commit to one. 

  

Muggleton suggests that the speed with which fashion and styles change means that collective action by young people isn't possible.

  

> Some postmodernists now suggest that the style and beliefs of previous subcultures such as hippies amounted to very little more than a few people taking to the lifestyle, while receiving excessive attention.

  

Hodkinson (2002) states that for a substantial number of young people, membership of a youth culture is very significant, with people adopting a particular sub-cultural lifestyle, norms and values over long periods of times. Thronton (1995) and MacDonald (2001) have come to similar conclusion.

  

Alix Sharkey (1993) identified five 'tribes' each of which had an identifiable style and a taste in music. Young people no longer subscribe to one set of behaviours forming a single youth culture, but that it is a collection of youth subcultures which are known as neo-tribes. These descriptions though subjective, suggest not a single youth culture but a collection of different co-existing youth subcultures, or neo-tribes.
