## Demonised Youth Cultures
so basically the BENEFIT SCROUNGERS ðŸ‘¹

### Neets
> Not in education, employment or training
> More likely to remain benefit dependent throughout their lives
> Shildrick and RUddy argued that focussing on NETs as a problem overlooks the nature of the work available to young people (0-hour contracts etc.)

### Teenage mums
> Commonly held but mainly mythical belief of obtaining a council-house through teen pregnancy
> Conservative Party proposed that housing for teenage mothers should be cut.
> Fiona Weir pointed to this being a stereotype and incorrect; teen pregnancy is falling and only 2% of single parents are teenagers.

### Gangs
> The association between youth and crime is long standing and there is some basis in fact.
> More likely to be convicted of a crime than older people.
> 22% of serious violence and nearly half of all shoaotings in London attributed to gang violence.
> London has the lowest murder rate in over 30 years.

### Mental Health
> Number of medical and social studies suggest that young people have more mental health problems
> Higher levels of self-harm and anxiety
> Charles Murray suggest that the problem is poor parenting2

> Summary of Marxist View

- Passive Learners - Obedient
- Reproduces class inequality of capitalist world
- Promote middle class values
- Legitamises class inequality
- Not really a meritocracy


# The Hidden Curriculum
> Althusser argues that the norms and values perpetuated in schools are middle-class and ruling-class values

# Public and Private School
> Money determines how good of an education you get

## The Myth of Meritocracy
> If we fail we believe its our own fault, even if it isn't.
> This legitamises and justifies the system even ifits not.
> The more we live in false consciousness; the less likely revolution is etc.

# Bowels and Gintis
> Schooling in Capitalist America; reproduction and legitimation of class inequality.
> We learn passive subservience of <workers/students> to <managers/teachers>
> We learn hierarchy
> We learn external influence of <grades/money>
