## Karl Marx
---
>*From each according to his ability, to each according to his need*
---

Karl Marx is the founder of Marxism and created an abundance of literature, including *Das Kapital* and *The Communist Manifesto* which would go on to spark political revolution and policy for years to come.
### Selected Ideas
 - *Cultural Hegemony* -- Relates very closely to [[Education]], where Marx proposes that cultural hegemony is the dominance of a culturally diverse society by the ruling class who shape the culture of that society. ^culturalhegemony
- *Exploitation of the Working Class* -- Through the use of the M-C-M+ cycle and C-M-C cycle, alongside surplus labour value, Marx claimed that, to realize their profits, capitalists **must** exploit workers ^exploitationofmasses

Similar to [[Functionalism#Durkheim|Durkheim]], Marx posed many theories for the whole of *society* not just education or socialisation, and therefore to gauge what Marxists think of education, we must look at other Marxists scholars who applied his theories to education.

>*The middle classes have a truly extraordinary conception of society. They really believe that human beings . . . have real existence only if they make money or help to make it.*
---

Friedrich Engels both funded and help write a large portion of Marx's work, alongside working on a large volume of works himself.
### Selected Ideas
 - *Capitalism and Patriarchy* -- Despite being a Marxist first and foremost, Engels believed that inherently, the struggle of women was linked to the struggle of women, and was thus later deemed a feminist.

## Paul Willis
---
> *The difficult thing to explain about how middle class kids get middle class jobs is why others let them. The difficult thing to explain about how working class kids get working class jobs is why they let themselves.*
---

Known for his work on *Learning to Labour*, which served as the foundations of [[#Neo Marxist|Neo Marxist]] thought on the working class and education.

### Selected Ideas
 - *The Counter School Culture* -- Willis believed that working class youths actively notice, recognise and rebel against 
 - *Penetration and Limitation* -- Working class white boys were able to 'penetrate' and notice their class oppression, but where 'limited' by their understanding being emotional and masculine rather than intellectual and anti-patriarchal.
