|I will use text boxes to allow KimsKarate instructors to input their information, for example the groups they are responsible for.|Once instructor details have been entered using the KimsKarate user interface, I will write each instructor’s information out into a text file called ‘instructors.txt’|As I have stored the KimsKarate instructors in a text file, I will be able to search for individual instructors using the key field of InstructorID. I will search through the text file sequentially until I find the InstructorID I am looking for. I will be opening the file in read/write mode as it requires reading and writing to.|

|When the data is inputted into the KimsKarate user interface, I will ensure that all data is sensible. For example, I would use a format check on the instructor’s emails to ensure that it contains an @ symbol. I could also use a range check on the instructor’s DOB to ensure they are over 18|When KimsKarate inputs test results into their pupil’s data, their grade must be calculated. I will use a local variable to store the total of all test results, as this information will not be used outside of the scope of inputting pupil test results and calculating their grade. This will aid in memory-optimisation and debugging.|I will use appropriate data types for KimsKarate’s solution. For example, I will store the pupil test results as a Real, as they may be stored as a percentage and therefore have a decimal place. I will also store the InstructorID and other such primary keys as integers, as a decimal place is not needed. By effectively choosing the data type, I can perform memory-optimisation.|
