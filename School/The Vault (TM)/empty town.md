and in the morning.
i will see him
i will find him
or he'll find me
because
he needs me
and i need him
he needs me
but i need him

we can run away together
and leave this empty town
we can love and hate and fuck 
and say we'll never let you down
and if the rain comes in too early
we will find a better place
or put up a black umbrella
and say it to his face

and in the afternoon 
i'll write him songs
and he will tear them up
splash ink over my page
and lick up ever drop
because
he needs me
and i do him
he needs me
as i do him

we can stay here for forever
make peace with empty towns
we can love and hate and fuck
and say i'm sorry, i let you down
and if the sun comes up tommorow
we will chase the setting moon
ride horses in the night
and get there before noon

we can stand still for forever
and plant feet on hollow ground
pour concrete on our faces
watch as it whispers down
and as we turn to stone
i will try say it to his face
you may need me but when by your side
it is i who's out of place
i will leave this empty place.
fuck this empty place
